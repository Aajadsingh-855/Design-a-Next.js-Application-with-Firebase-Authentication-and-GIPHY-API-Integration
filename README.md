# Design-a-Next.js-Application-with-Firebase-Authentication-and-GIPHY-API-Integration
1. Project Setup:

Create a new Next.js project: npx create-next-app@latest my-giphy-app
Install dependencies: npm install firebase axios
2. Firebase Integration:

Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication.
Add the Firebase SDK to your Next.js project.
Initialize Firebase with your project configuration.
3. Authentication Pages:

Create pages for:
Sign-in: Handle sign-in with email/password or social providers.
Sign-up: Allow users to create new accounts.
Profile: Display user information and manage settings.
4. Protected Routes:

Use Firebase's onAuthStateChanged to protect routes requiring authentication.
Redirect unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.
5. GIPHY API Integration:

Obtain a GIPHY API key.
Create a component to fetch and display GIFs based on user input.
Use Axios or fetch to make requests to the GIPHY API.
Display GIFs responsibly, respecting GIPHY's terms of use.
6. Additional Considerations:

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for authentication and API calls.
Styling: Apply custom styling to match your app's design.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure functionality.
Deployment: Deploy to a hosting platform like Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
